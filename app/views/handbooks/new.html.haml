  %h2 what's it all about?
  %p We created this page because we have observed a dangerous lack of structure in the corporate world, particularly in the fragile environment of the startup ecosystem.
  %p Startups tend to ignore necessary bureaucracy. Consequently, their values are only vaguely defined and, henceforth, they are not successful in executing them.
  %p We believe following a set of rudimentary rules is necessary to: overcome forthcoming challenges, maintain efforts to deliver top execution, ensure peak performance of the workforce, generate passion, involvement and achievement and finally, maintain motivation to design and deliver market-leading products and solutions.
